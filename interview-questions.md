# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is the input function definiton while an argument is the actual value passed in to the function.

Researched answer: In functions, there are parameters and arguments. Parameters act as placeholders for information, or arguments, to be passed in when a function is being used.

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: A class is just the blueprint for an object.

Researched answer: An object is a data type that holds collections of information in the form of pairs. A class is the blueprint for objects and, like functions, can be reused and customized as needed.

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is to execute a set of instructions over and over again until a condition is met.

Researched answer: In Javascript, loops are needed when we need to execute code over items in a code, typically elements in an array, until a condition is met. The process of repeating a set of instructions over and over again until a condition is met is called iteration.

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer: Hoisting is a mechanism in javascript that brings variables and functions, regardless of their scope is local or global, to the top. It allows declarations to be processed before any code is actually executed.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Spread operator: The spread syntax is a way to take an iterable, like an array or a string, and use it to fill in multiple slots or elements. For instance, you can use it to provide arguments for a function or add elements to an array. When used with an object, it takes the properties of that object and merges them with the properties of another object you're creating.

2. React: Created by Meta (formerly Facebook) when their website was scaling faster than they could keep up with, React is an open-source front-end Javascript library. It can be used to build a diverse range of applications from singe-page applications to those rendered on servers. It uses components which are individual, reusable pieces of code.

3. JSX: Created for use in Facebook's React library, JSX is an extension for Javascript that allows for creation of DOM trees. DOM trees act as a neutral link between HTML and languages such as Javascript.
